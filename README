This is just a quick script I wrote to wrap the s3cmd sync command
in a script I could use with a configuration file, rather than doing
each directory line by line.

I'm not thrilled with the XML config format, and would rather use an
Apache style config, or something generally more legible. Although
I'm thinking about rewriting it in Python, so it would be nice to keep
the config file format fairly generic.

See s3cmd_backup.conf.example in this root directory for the format of
the XML config file.
